//! The **audio engine**: a DSP pipeline that sits between librespot's decoder
//! and the audio backend.
//!
//! librespot decodes audio into interleaved `f64` samples and hands them to a
//! [`Sink`](librespot::playback::audio_backend::Sink). Instead of writing those
//! samples straight to the backend, Riff routes them through a
//! [`ProcessorChain`]: an ordered list of [`Processor`]s that can equalize, mix
//! to mono, pitch-shift, and (eventually) mix in additional sources before the
//! audio reaches the speakers.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! librespot decoder
//!        │  AudioPacket::Samples
//!        ▼
//!   CaptureSink  ── implements librespot's Sink trait (the boundary)
//!        │  AudioBuffer
//!        ▼
//!   ProcessorChain
//!        │   EqProcessor → MonoProcessor → PanProcessor → PitchProcessor → MixProcessor
//!        ▼
//!   backend Sink (PulseAudio / ALSA / GStreamer)
//! ```
//!
//! Each [`Processor`] operates in place on an [`AudioBuffer`]. Processors expose
//! [`Processor::is_active`] so the chain can cheaply skip stages that would not
//! change the audio (e.g. a flat EQ or disabled mono). Live configuration
//! updates are delivered through per-processor *controllers* that use a
//! lock-free generation counter, so the audio thread never blocks on the UI.
